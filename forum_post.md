**Title**: WalletD: Successful ICP Integration for Wallet SDK

Hi DFINITY community,

I’m excited to share that WalletD, an open-source Rust-based wallet SDK, has successfully integrated 
ICP support! Key features include:
- ICRC-1 ledger canister deployment for token transfers.
- Smart contract interactions (`icrc2_approve`, `icrc2_transfer_from`, `batch_transfer`).
- Cross-chain swaps (`swap_icp_to_btc`).

We’re seeking feedback, contributions, and developers to join our ecosystem. Check out the project 
on GitHub: [insert repo link]. Any tips on optimizing canister deployment or integrating with 
cross-chain bridges?

Thanks,
Aslan
