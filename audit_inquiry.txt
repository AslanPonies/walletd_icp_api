Subject: Audit Inquiry for WalletD SDK

Dear [CertiK/Cyvers Team],

I’m developing WalletD, an open-source Rust-based wallet SDK with ICP integration. We’re seeking a 
comprehensive security audit for our canister-based implementation. Can you provide details on your 
audit process, timeline, and pricing?

Best,
Aslan
